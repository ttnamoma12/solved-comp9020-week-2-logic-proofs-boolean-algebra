   <li>See pages 21–23 of the lecture slides week 2 and answer the two questions.</li>

   <li>The country of Mew is inhabited by two types of people: liars always lie and “truars” always tell the truth. At a cocktail party the newly appointed Australian ambassador to Mew talked to three inhabitants. Peter remarked that Joan and Shane were liars. Shane denied he was a liar, but Joan said that Shane was indeed a liar. Now the ambassador wondered how many of the three were liars.</li>

Digital circuits are often built only from nand-gates with two inputs and one output. The function nand:

is defined by  or, equivalently, . Show that any Boolean

function can be encoded with only nand-gates.
